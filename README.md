# Databased logging tool for TCP and UDP data transfers.

This repository contains the documents for my project which I created for my final examination. The goal of this project was to create a service that runs on a development server. 
The service logs incoming and outgoing TCP and UDP data transfers and writes the results into a database. An additional GUI config application helps to set up the service. 
It helps to define filter rules to define what should be logged and what not. Also, optional emails for notification about actual data transfers can be defined. And it gives 
also an overview of the collected data. 

The service and the GUI config Application are based on C#.

The documentation as PDF format and the presentation as MS PowerPoint format are both in German.
